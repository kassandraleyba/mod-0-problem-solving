# Given a sentence with only lowercase letters, print the same sentence with the first letter of 
# every word capitalized. For example, if you were given "Turing is the best", return "Turing Is 
# The Best" instead!

# Make an all lowercase word sentence and print a new sentence with each first letter capitalized.
# Step 1: Create a string with all lowercase variable.
# Step 2: Add a method and an argument to capitalize the first letter of each word
